From a computational point of view, we have to convert these signals into a measurable representation that a machine is able to read and process.

We always use **window size** > **hop size**, therefore there is an overlap of windows, which actually provides a smoother chaining and better frequency analysis. A particular window function is applied to each frame to ensure a more natural overlap. For our computational musicology studies, this representation is very important.\n",
