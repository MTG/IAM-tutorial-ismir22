From a computational point of view, we have to convert these signals into a measurable representation that a machine is able to read and process. In other words, these signals must be digitalized or discretizing the continuous (or analog) sound into a representable sequence of values. See an example in {numref}`digital_signal`.\n",

We always use **window size** > **hop size**, therefore there is an overlap of windows, which actually provides a smoother chaining and better frequency analysis. A particular window function is applied to each frame to ensure a more natural overlap. For our computational musicology studies, this representation is very important."
