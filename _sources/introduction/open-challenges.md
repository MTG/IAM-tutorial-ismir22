# Open challenges

In this page we review some of the open challenges that remain unsolved or unaddressed in the field of computational musicology for Carnatic and Hindustani Music. 

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, we only intend to provide, few research ideas and open challanges that may be tackled on top of the work that has been done throughout the past years. 

## Music source separation for Indian Art Music

As already discussed in this tutorial, the problem of source separation in Carnatic and Hindustani Music remains unsolved. While currently available pre-trained models (e.g. Spleeter, Demucs) do not properly generalize to these repertoires, current bespoke solutions for Indian Art Music do not reach the performance level that is achieved for Western modern and mainstream recordings.

The shortage of completely isolated recordings hinders to proper training and testing of DL-based solutions for Carnatic and Hindustani separation. Since these repertoire are normally performed in live performances, it is difficult to gather individual stems that present the ecologically-valid correlation and musical connexion, making the task more complicated.


## Svara-level transcription

Despite vocal ornamentation is a core aspect in the Carnatic and Hindustani melodic framework, svara(note)-level transcription is also relevant for ... TODO


## Melodic motif discovery

Automatically spotting and understanding melodic motifs and phrases in Carnatic and Hindustani music is key to extract musically relevant information from the recordings. This has been a widely explored problem, with many approaches aiming at discovery characteristic phrases, and also relating those with additional features of the Indian Art Music performances (e.g. video, gestures, and more).

Although huge advances have been done towards addressing this relevant task, again, the shortage of manual expert annotations and the extreme complexity and time-consumption of compiling those, makes the task complicated to tackle. A large amount of motif-level annotations would allow for:

* Data-driven solutions to such problem
* Reliable validation of proposed solutions
* Multi-annotator data which would probably improve generalization
