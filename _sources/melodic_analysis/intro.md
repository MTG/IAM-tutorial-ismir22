# IAM melodic framework


The melodic framework of the Indian Art Music traditions is built around the concept of rāga in Carnatic and raag in Hindustani music. Built on top of a single tonic (shadjam), the rāga provides the rules for the melodic performance, which combines precomposed and improvised elements.  In this part of the tutorial, attendees will study tools for the identification of the tonic [7], and the extraction of the predominant melody, in the form of continuous and time-aligned pitch contours [8]. These important features are subsequently used for the tasks of intonation analysis [9], melodic pattern recognition [10, 11], and rāga identification [12, 13, 14].
