The most popular performance format today is vocal-led, either by a single or multiple vocalists.
* The vocalist is typically accompanied by a violinist. In compositions, the violinist plays in unison with the vocalist, or at the octave, leading to a largely monophonic melodic texture between the two. At other times, in the more improvisational sections (known as manodharma saṅgīta), the violinist shadows the vocalist, leading to a more heterophonic melodic texture. 
* The percussion section is led by the mṛdaṅgam (double-ended drum), and other percussion instruments may include the ghaṭam (clay pot), kañjīra (small frame drum), and morsing (mouth harp).
* An important feature is the tambūrā drone played throughout. This can be performed using either the physical instrument, the tambūrā, or an electronic imitation of the instrument, known as a śruti box. 


> **Implications for MIR:**
> Notwithstanding the dominant monophonic melodic line, the overall instrumental texture is heterophonic, which is a challenge for predominant pitch extraction.


### Instrumental-led performances

There are also instrumental-led performances, without vocalists: for example, groups led by vīṇa, veṇu (flute), violin, saxophone, mandolin, and others.

In addition, there is the closely related tradition, Periya Mēḷam, performed more often in temple and ritual settings but also having a concert tradition. Here the main instruments are nāgasvaram, tavil and tāḷam cymbals.

> Presently, in MIR on South Indian art music there is a greater focus on Carnatic vocal performance. However, instrumental-led performances are an important
