## Rhythm and Percussion in Carnatic Music
The rhythmic framework is based on cyclic metrical structures called the tāl in Hindustani music and tāḷa in Carnatic music. Both words originate from Sanskrit and have the same literal meaning of a “hand-clap”. For consistency and convenience, when it is clear from the context, we will use the word tāḷa to mean both tāl and tāḷa when we refer collectively to the two traditions, and use the respective terms when referring to each music culture individually.

The rāga and tāḷa are the most important metadata associated with a composition and hence a recording of the composition. Each composition is composed in one or more rāgas and tāḷas.

### Meter
{cite}`Sambamoorthy_1998` provides a detailed description of tāḷas in Carnatic music. In Carnatic music, the tāḷa provides a broad structure for repetition of music phrases, motifs and improvisations. It consists of fixed length time cycles called āvartana which can be referred to as the tāḷa cycle. In an āvartana of a tāḷa, phrase refrains, melodic and rhythmic changes usually occur at the beginning of the cycle. An āvartana is divided into basic equidistant time units called akṣaras. The first akṣara pulse of each āvartana is called the sama, which marks the beginning of the cycle (or the end of the previous cycle, due to the cyclic nature of the tāḷa). The sama is often accented, with notable melodic and percussive events. Each tāḷa also has a distinct, possibly non-regular division of the cycle period into sections called the aṅga. The aṅgas serve to indicate the current position in the āvartana and aid the musician to keep track of the movement through the tāḷa cycle. A movement through a tāḷa cycle is explicitly shown by the musician using hand gestures, based on the aṅgas of the tāḷa.

The common definition of an isochronous (equally spaced in time) beat pulsation, as the time instances where a human listener is likely to tap his/her foot to the music, is likely to cause problems in Carnatic music. Due the explicit hand gestures, listeners familiar to Carnatic music tend to tap to a non-isochronous sequence of beats in certain tāḷas. Hence we use an adapted definition of a beat for the purpose of a common ground, defined as a uniform pulsation. It is to be noted however that an equidistant beat pulsation can later help in obtaining the musically relevant possibly irregular beat sequence that is a subset of the equidistant beat pulses. The akṣaras in an āvartana are grouped into equal length units, which we will refer to as the beats of the tāḷa. The perceptually relevant hand/foot tapping time “beats” are a subset of this uniform beat pulsation.

The subdivision grouping structure of the akṣaras within a beat is called the naḍe (also spelled naḍai) or gati. The most common naḍe is caturaśra, in which a beat is divided into 4 akṣaras (in duples, equivalently 2 akṣaras). Another important aspect of rhythm in Carnatic music is the eḍupu, the “phase” or offset of the lead melody, relative to the sama of the tāḷa. With a non-zero eḍupu, the composition does not start on the sama, but before (atīta) or after (anāgata) the beginning of the tāḷa cycle. This offset is predominantly for the convenience of the musician for a better exposition of the tāḷa in certain compositions. However, eḍupu is also used for ornamentation in many cases. Though there are significant differences in terms of scale and length, as an analogy, the concepts of akṣara, the beat, and the āvartana of Carnatic music bear analogy to the subdivision, beat and the bar metrical levels of Eurogenetic music. Further, aṅga are the possibly unequal length sections of the tāḷa, formed by grouping of beats.

Carnatic music has a sophisticated tāḷa system that incorporates the concepts described above. There are seven basic tāḷas defined with different aṅgas, each with five variants leading to the popular 35 tāḷa system (Sambamoorthy, 1998). Each of these 35 tāḷas can be set in five different naḍe, leading to 175 different combinations. However, most of these tāḷas are extremely rare in performances with just over a ten tāḷas that can be regularly seen in concerts. A majority of pieces are composed in four popular tāḷas - ādi, rūpaka, miśra chāpu, and khaṇḍa chāpu. The structure of those four popular tāḷas in Carnatic music are described in {numref}`carnatic_talas_table` and illustrated in {numref}`carnatic_talas_fig`, all in caturaśra naḍe (division of a beat into two or four akṣaras). The different concepts related to the tāḷas of Carnatic music are also illustrated in {numref}`carnatic_talas_fig`. The figure shows the akṣaras with time-ticks, beats of the cycle with numbered longer time-ticks, and the sama in the cycle using ×. The aṅga boundaries are highlighted using bold and long time-ticks e.g. ādi tāḷa has 8 beats in a cycle, with 4 akṣaras in each beat leading to 32 akṣaras in a cycle, while rūpaka tāḷa has 12 akṣaras in a cycle, with 4 akṣaras in each of its 3 beats.

The case of non-isochronous beat tāḷas, miśra chāpu and khaṇḍa chāpu, need a special mention here. {numref}`carnatic_talas_fig` shows miśra chāpu to consist 14 akṣaras in a cycle. The 14 akṣaras have a definite unequal grouping structure of 6+4+4 (or 6+8 in some cases) and the boundaries of these groups are shown with visual gestures, and hence form the beats of this tāḷa {cite}`Sambamoorthy_1998`. However, in common practice, miśra chāpu can also be divided into seven equal beats. In this dissertation, we consider miśra chāpu to consist of seven uniform beats as numbered in {numref}`carnatic_talas_fig`, with beats ×, 4 and 6 being visually displayed. Similarly, khaṇḍa chāpu has 10 akṣaras in a cycle grouped into two groups as 4+6.

(carnatic-percussion)=
### Percussion in Performance
Most performances of Carnatic music are accompanied by the percussion instrument mridangam (mr̥daṅgaṁ), a double-sided barrel drum. There could however be other percussion accompaniments such as ghaṭam (the clay pot), khañjira (the Indian tambourine), tavil (a two sided drum) and mōrsiṅg (the Indian jaw harp), which follow the mridangam closely. All these instruments (except the khañjira) are pitched percussion instruments and are tuned to the tonic of the lead voice. Since the progression through the tāḷa cycles is explicitly shown through hand gestures, the mridangam is provided with substantial freedom of rhythmic improvisation during the performance. The tāḷa only provides a metrical construct, within which several different rhythmic patterns can be played and improvised.

The solo performed with the percussion accompaniments, called a tani-āvartana, demonstrates the wide variety of rhythms that can be played in a particular tāḷa. The solo performance by the percussion ensemble follows the main piece of the concert. The solo is an elaborate rhythmic improvisation within the framework of the tāḷa, but with much improvisation on the percussion patterns. The tani strives to present a showcase of the tāḷa with a variety of percussion and rhythmic patterns that can be played in the tala. The percussion instruments duel and complement each other in a solo of each instrument, with all instruments coming together to a cadential end. The patterns played can last longer than one āvartana, but stay within the framework of the tāḷa. A tani-āvartana is a showcase of the skill and talent of the percussion artists. It is replete with a variety of percussion patterns and hence is very useful for analysis of percussion patterns. The tani is often performed with a subset of the percussion instruments. The mridangam is always present, while the other instruments are optional.

(solkattu)=
### Solkaṭṭu
Percussion in Carnatic music is organized and transmitted orally with the use of onomatopoeic oral mnemonic syllables (called solkaṭṭu) representative of the different strokes of the mridangam. An oral recitation of these syllables is itself an art form called konnakōl, and is often a part of a tani-āvartana. The syllables used belong to mridangam, but is widely used with other percussion instruments used in Carnatic music. These syllables vary across schools, but provide a good representation system to define, describe and discover percussion patterns.

We consulted a senior professional Carnatic percussionist for the complete set of strokes that can be played with the mridangam. The stroke syllables of the mridangam represent the combined timbre of the left and right drum heads, and hence over 45 different strokes can be played on the mridangam. However, many of the timbrally similar strokes can be grouped together into syllable groups, assuming that such a timbral grouping is sufficient for discovery of timbrally similar percussion patterns. This timbre based grouping further enables us to work with the variability in syllables across different schools. The syllable groups, the symbol we use for them in this dissertation, and a short description is shown in {numref}`solkattu`. The different stroke names are not indicated in the table since they vary. For simplicity and brevity, we will refer to the syllable groups as just syllables in this work when there is no ambiguity. Finally however, we carefully note that the syllables also have a loosely defined functional role, and such a timbre based grouping used in this document is an approximation done only for computational analysis approaches.

```{table} The syllables (solkaṭṭus) used in mridangam, grouped based on timbre along with the symbol we use for the syllable group in this dissertation. The last column also provides a short description. Most strokes are combinations of left+right strokes on the mridangam.
