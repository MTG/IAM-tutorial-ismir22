IAM rhythmic framework
======================

In this part of the tutorial we cover several state-of-the-art tools for the rhythmic analysis of IAM traditions. The rhythmic framework in these traditions, referred to as tāla, encompasses specific features that must be considered in order to perform relevant research in the topic. We present here methods to identify and characterize tāla [15], and to perform rhythmic pattern analysis of performances on the mridangam (Carnatic Music) [16] and tabla (Hindustani Music) [17, 18].
