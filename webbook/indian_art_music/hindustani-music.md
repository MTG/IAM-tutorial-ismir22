## Rhythm and Percussion in Hindustani Music
As previously mentioned, several different styles of Hindustani music exist, each with it's own variation of instrumentation. For example, the percussive accompaniment in a typical khyāl performance is the tabla, in the dhrupad style, it is the pakhāvaj. Here we focus on khyāl, the most popular style.

The artists in Hindustani music belong to what are called gharānās, or stylistic schools. Though all the gharānā use the same music concepts and basic style, each of them have their own nuances that are well distinguished and documented {cite}`mehta_2008`.

### Meter
{cite}`clayton_2000` provides a comprehensive introduction to rhythm in Hindustani music. The definition of tāl in Hindustani music is similar to the tāḷa in Carnatic music. A tāl has fixed-length cycles, each of which is called an āvart. An āvart is divided into isochronous basic time units called mātrā. The mātrās of a tāl are grouped into sections, sometimes with unequal time-spans, called the vibhāgs. Vibhāgs are indicated through the hand gestures of a thālī (clap) and a khālī (wave). The first mātrā of an āvart (the downbeat) is referred to as sam, marking the end of the previous cycle and the beginning of the next cycle. The first mātrā of the cycle (sam) is highly significant structurally, with many important melodic and rhythmic events happening at the sam. The sam also frequently marks the coming together of the rhythmic streams of soloist and accompanist, and the resolution point for rhythmic tension {cite}`clayton_2000`.

```{table} Structure of Hindustani tāls. For each tāl, the number of vibhāgs and the number of mātrās in each āvart is shown. The last column of the table shows the grouping of the mātrās in the āvart into vibhāgs, and the length of each vibhāg, e.g. each avart of rūpak tāl has three vibhāgs consisting of three, two, two mātrās respectively

There are also tempo classes called lay in Hindustani music which can vary between ati-vilaṁbit (very slow), vilaṁbit (slow), madhya (medium), dr̥t (fast) to ati-dhr̥t (very fast). Depending on the lay, the mātrā may be further subdivided into shorter time-span pulsations, indicated through additional filler strokes of the tabla. However, since these pulses are not well defined in music theory, we consider mātrā to be lowest level pulse in the scope of this work.

As with Carnatic music, in Hindustani music there are significant differences in terminology describing meter when compared with Eurogenetic music. The definition of beat pulsation, as foot tapping instances in time, is also a problem with Hindustani music. Depending on the lay, the mātrā can be defined to be the subdivisions (for dr̥t lay) or as beats (for vilaṁbit and madhya lay). To maintain consistency, using accepted conventions, we note that the concepts of mātrā and the āvart of Hindustani music bear analogy to the beat and the bar metrical levels of Eurogenetic music. This implies that there is no well defined subdivision pulsation defined in Hindustani music. The possibly unequal vibhāgs are the sections of the tāl.

There are over 70 different Hindustani tāls defined, while about 15 tāls are performed in practice. {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig` shows four popular Hindustani tāls - tīntāl, ēktāl, jhaptāl, and rūpak tāl. The structure of these tāls are also described in {numref}`hind-tala-tab`. The figure also shows the sam (shown as ×) and the vibhāgs (indicated with thālī/khālī pattern using numerals). A khālī is shown with a 0, while the thālī are shown with non-zero numerals. The thālī and khālī pattern of a tāl decides the accents of the tāl. The sam has the strongest accent (with certain exceptions, such as rūpak tāl) followed by the thālī instants. The khālī instants have the least accent.

```

A jhaptāl āvart has 10 mātrās with four unequal vibhāgs ({numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`d), while a tīntāl āvart has 16 mātrās with four equal vibhāgs ({numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`a). We can also note from {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`b that the sam is a khāli in rūpak tāl, which has 7 mātrās with three unequal vibhāgs.

The special case of ēktāl needs additional mention here. Ēktāl has six equal duration vibhāgs and 12 mātrās in a cycle as shown in {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`c. However, in dr̥t lay, an alternative structure emerges, which is represented as four equal duration vibhāgs of three mātrās each as shown in {numref}`ektal`. For consistency, we use the structure as shown in {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig` here.

### Percussion in Performance
Hindustani music uses the tabla as the main percussion accompaniment. It consists of two drums: a left hand bass drum called the bāyān or diggā and a right hand drum called the dāyān that can produce a variety of pitched sounds.

Tabla acts as the timekeeper during the performance indicating the progression through the tāl cycles using pre-defined rhythmic patterns (called the ṭhēkā) for each tāl. The lead musician improvises over these cycles, with limited rhythmic improvisation during the main piece. The ṭhēkās are specific canonical tabla bōl patterns defined for each tāl as illustrated in {numref}`thekas`. However, the musician playing tabla improvises these patterns playing many variations with filler strokes and short improvisatory patterns. {cite}`miron_2011`, {cite}`clayton_2000`, {cite}`a_e_dutta_1995`, {cite}`beronja_2008`, and {cite}`naimpalli_2005` provide a more detailed discussion of tāl in Hindustani music including ṭhēkās for commonly used tāls.

To showcase the nuances of a tāl as well as the skill of the percussionist with the tabla, Hindustani music performances feature tabla solos. A tabla solo is intricate and elaborate, with a variety of pre-composed forms used for developing further elaborations. There are specific principles that govern these elaborations {cite}`gottlieb_1993`. Musical forms of tabla such as the ṭhēkā, kāyadā, palaṭā, rēlā, pēśkār and gaṭ are a part of the solo performance and have different functional and aesthetic roles in a solo performance. A percussion solo shows a variety of improvisation possible in the framework of the tāl, with the role of timekeeping taken up by the lead musician during the solo.

In Hindustani music, the tempo is measured in mātrās per minute (MPM). The music has a wide range of tempo, divided into tempo classes called lay as described before. The mainly performed ones are the the slow (vilaṁbit), medium (madhya), and fast (dr̥t) classes. The boundary between these tempo classes is not well defined with possible overlaps. In this dissertation, after consultation with a professional Hindustani musician, we use the commonly agreed tempo ranges for these classes: vilaṁbit lay for a median tempo between 10-60 MPM, madhya lay for 60-150 MPM, and dr̥t lay for >150 MPM. This large range of allowed tempi means that the duration of a tāl cycle in Hindustani music ranges from less than 2 seconds to over a minute. A mātrā in vilaṁbit lay hence can last about 6 seconds, and to maintain a continuous rhythmic pulse, several filler strokes are played on the tabla. Hence the surface rhythm apparent from audio recordings can be quite different from the underlying metrical structure.

### Bōls
Similar to mridangam, the tabla repertoire is transmitted using onomatopoeic oral mnemonic syllables called the bōl. Tabla has different stylistic schools called gharānās. The repertoires of major gharānās of tabla differ in aspects such as the use of specific bōls, the dynamics of strokes, ornamentation and rhythmical phrases {cite}`beronja_2008`. But there are also many similarities due to the fact that the same forms and standard phrases reappear across these repertoires {cite}`gottlieb_1993`.

The bōls of the tabla vary marginally within and across gharānās, and several bōls can represent the same stroke on the tabla. To address this issue, we grouped the full set of 38 syllables into timbrally similar groups resulting into a reduced set of 18 syllable groups as shown in {numref}`bols`. Though each syllable on its own has a functional role, this timbral grouping is presumed to be sufficient for discovery of percussion patterns. For this work, we limit ourselves to the reduced set of syllable groups and use them to represent patterns. For convenience, when it is clear from the context, we call the syllable groups as just syllables and denote them by the symbols in {numref}`bols`. A brief description of the timbre is also provided for each syllable.

```{table} The bōls used in tabla are shown in second column, grouped by similarity of timbre. The symbol we use for the syllable group in the dissertation is shown in the third column and a short description of the timbre is shown in the fourth column. Combined stroke has strokes on left and right drum played together simultaneously.
