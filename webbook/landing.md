Presented at the International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) 2022, in Bengaluru, India.

## What is this tutorial about?
This tutorial is meant to be a starting point for cross-level researchers that aim at getting started on the computational analysis of Carnatic and Hindustani Music. While reading through this book you should expect to obtain:
* **Basic understanding of Carnatic and Hindustani Music**: important concepts and practices.
* **Overview of the computational analysis of the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions**: get yourself familiar with relevant tasks and open challenges of the topic, and gain experience with baseline approaches and research trends.
* **Python-based technologies to easily access data and tools for this topic**: learn about ``compiam``, the basic usage, and the entire set of options this software offers.
* **Get a starting point from where to start your research on the computational analysis of Indian Art Music**: we hope this tutorial provides the background for you to get started with researching this topic.
