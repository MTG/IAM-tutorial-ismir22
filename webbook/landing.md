# Computational Methods for Supporting Corpus-Based Research on Indian Art Music
**By Thomas Nuttall, Gen√≠s Plaja, Lara Pearson, Brindha Manickavasakan, Kaustuv Kanti Ganguli, Ajay Srinivasamurthy and Xavier Serra.**

Accompanying documentation and and walkthrough for the ISMIR 2022 tutorial <insert_link>

## Motivations

To create a centralized, community-driven repository of tools for the computational analysis of Indian Art Music.

## Expected learning outcomes
This tutorial is meant to be a starting point for cross-level researchers that aim at getting started on the computational analysis of Carnatic and Hindustani Music. The accompanying Python installable package ``compIAM`` is also designed to be a handy set of tools to (1) easily gain experience on baseline methods for the computational analysis of Indian Art Music and (2) serve as util package for further research on the said topic.

After going through this tutorial one should expect to:
* Outcome 1
* Outcome 2
* Outcome 3
