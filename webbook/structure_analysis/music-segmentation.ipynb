    "## A note on source separation for Indian Art Music\n",
    "As you may have noticed in the displayed audio above, even though `spleeter` is within the best out-of-the-box source separation models to use, we need to take into account some considerations in regards to the task of music source separation for Indian Art Music signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, although `spleeter` is trained with a massive amount of recordings, we can safely assume that Carnatic and Hindustani music do not have a considerable representation in the training set (this applies to the other out-of-the-box source separation models out there). In that sense, it is expected that these models struggle to generalize to Indian Art Music specific instruments and arrangements, which may cause abnormally low interference removal performance. The predominance of melodic monophonic accompaniment instruments in both [Carnatic](carnatic-instrumentation) (the violin being the most common case) and [Hindustani](hindustani-instrumentation) (harmonium in this case), the [tambura drone](carnatic-tambura-drone), the pitched percussion... These are high-level examples of elements that may cause the standardized source separation models to not generalize properly to Indian Art Music signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is more, the standardized source separation models target whether *vocals* and *accompaniment*, or *vocals*, *bass*, *drums*, and *other*. While to separate the singing voice from an accompaniment is OK, the *4 stem* configuration is far from being representative of the actual Carnatic and Hindustani Music arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, another factor that is currently blocking the research on music source separation for Indian Art Music is the shortage of available datasets for this task. We have observed that the Saraga Carnatic collection has multi-track audio, but this has leakage (it has been recorded in live performances). In such case, a leakage-aware approach would be needed to use this data. Alternatively, a music source separation dataset including completely isolated and aligned tracks, which to the best of our knowledge is unavailable as of now, would open the door the music source separation research on Indian Art Music."
