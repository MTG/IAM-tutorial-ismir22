    "[mirdata](https://mirdata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an open-source and pip-installable Python library that provides tools for working with common Music Information Retrieval (MIR) datasets. Given the crucial importance and relevance of such a software for data and corpus-driven research, we have done a great effort integrating several IAM-centered datasets in mirdata. To date, the following datasets can be found in the latest mirdata release:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Carnatic collection of Saraga [x]\n",
    "* Hindustani collection of Saraga [x]\n",
    "* Carnatic Varnam Dataset [x]\n",
    "* Carnatic Music Rhythm [x]\n",
    "* Hindustani Music Rhythm [x]\n",
    "* Indian Art Music Raga Dataset [x]\n",
    "* Mridangam Stroke Dataset [x]\n",
    "* Four-Way Tabla Dataset (ISMIR 2021) [x]\n",
    "\n",
    "compIAM provides access to these datasets through the mirdata loaders. Therefore, by using an alias of mirdata method ``mirdata.initialize()`` as ``compiam.initialize()`` you can also access the datasets integrated to mirdata!"
