# Indian Art Music

The tutorial covers two contemporary styles – Carnatic and Hindustani – that have a shared history, but developed in different ways {cite}`sambamoorthy_history_1960, powers_india_2001`. The two styles are often grouped together under the concept of ‘Indian Art Music’, as is the case in this tutorial.

## Carnatic Music
**Carnatic music, or Karṇāṭaka Saṅgīta,** is a style of art and devotional music performed largely in South India. See an example below featuring T.M. Krishna performing the Mysore Vasudevacharya composition "Brocevarevarura Ninnu Vina Raghuvara" in Rāga Khamās, accompanied by Akkarai Subhalakshmi on violin, Arunprakash Krishnan on mridangam and Chandrasekara Sharma on ghatam. Tambūrā support is by Vignesh Krishnamurthy and Ritwik Pal. Video from the First Edition Arts Channel.

## Hindustani Music
Meanwhile, **Hindustani music** is the term used to refer to the related styles performed more in the north of India. An example is given below featuring Ashwini Bhide Deshpande performing Rāg Rāgeśrī at the FEA-curated Gayatri Festival 2016. She is accompanied by Vishwanath Shirodkar on tabla, Seema Shirodkar on harmonium, Swarangi Marathe and Shamika Bhide on tambūrās and supporting vocals. Video from the First Edition Arts Channel.

These two categories act as convenient headings that group together closely related styles and formats. For example, within the Hindustani category lies khayāl, dhrupad, tarāna and ṭhumri; and closely allied to Carnatic music we have Periya Mēḷam.

Some of the shared features and differences between the Hindustani and Carnatic musical styles will become apparent in the following chapters.
