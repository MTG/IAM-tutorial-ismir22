# Rhythm
The rhythmic framework is based on cyclic metrical structures called
the tāl in Hindustani music and tāḷa in Carnatic music. Both words originate from Sanskrit and have the same literal meaning of a “hand-clap”. For consistency and convenience, when it is clear from the context, we will use the word tāḷa to mean both tāl and tāḷa when we refer collectively to the two traditions, and use the respective terms when referring to each music culture individually.

The rāga and tāḷa are the most important metadata associated with a composition and hence a recording of the composition.
Each composition is composed in one or more rāgas and tāḷas.

## Rhythm and Percussion in Carnatic Music

### Meter
{cite}`Sambamoorthy_1998` provides a detailed description of tāḷas in Carnatic music. In Carnatic music, the tāḷa provides a broad structure for repetition of music phrases, motifs and improvisations. It consists of fixed length time cycles called āvartana which can be referred to as the tāḷa cycle. In an āvartana of a tāḷa, phrase refrains, melodic and rhythmic changes usually occur at the beginning of the cycle. An āvartana is divided into basic equidistant time units called akṣaras. The first akṣara pulse of each āvartana is called the sama, which marks the beginning of the cycle (or the end of the previous cycle, due to the cyclic nature of the tāḷa). The sama is often accented, with notable melodic and percussive events. Each tāḷa also has a distinct, possibly non-regular division of the cycle period into sections called the aṅga. The aṅgas serve to indicate the current position in the āvartana and aid the musician to keep track of the movement through the tāḷa cycle. A movement through a tāḷa cycle is explicitly shown by the musician using hand gestures, based on the aṅgas of the tāḷa.

The common definition of an isochronous (equally spaced in time) beat pulsation, as the time instances where a human listener is likely to tap his/her foot to the music, is likely to cause problems in Carnatic music. Due the explicit hand gestures, listeners familiar to Carnatic music tend to tap to a non-isochronous sequence of beats in certain tāḷas. Hence we use an adapted definition of a beat for the purpose of a common ground, defined as a uniform pulsation. It is to be noted however that an equidistant beat pulsation can later help in obtaining the musically relevant possibly irregular beat sequence that is a subset of the equidistant beat pulses. The akṣaras in an āvartana are grouped into equal length units, which we will refer to as the beats of the tāḷa. The perceptually relevant hand/foot tapping time “beats” are a subset of this uniform beat pulsation.

The subdivision grouping structure of the akṣaras within a beat is called the naḍe (also spelled naḍai) or gati. The most common naḍe is caturaśra, in which a beat is divided into 4 akṣaras (in duples, equivalently 2 akṣaras). Another important aspect of rhythm in Carnatic music is the eḍupu, the “phase” or offset of the lead melody, relative to the sama of the tāḷa. With a non-zero eḍupu, the composition does not start on the sama, but before (atīta) or after (anāgata) the beginning of the tāḷa cycle. This offset is predominantly for the convenience of the musician for a better exposition of the tāḷa in certain compositions. However, eḍupu is also used for ornamentation in many cases. Though there are significant differences in terms of scale and length, as an analogy, the concepts of akṣara, the beat, and the āvartana of Carnatic music bear analogy to the subdivision, beat and the bar metrical levels of Eurogenetic music. Further, aṅga are the possibly unequal length sections of the tāḷa, formed by grouping of beats.

```

Carnatic music has a sophisticated tāḷa system that incorporates the concepts described above. There are seven basic tāḷas defined with different aṅgas, each with five variants leading to the popular 35 tāḷa system (Sambamoorthy, 1998). Each of these 35 tāḷas can be set in five different naḍe, leading to 175 different combinations. However, most of these tāḷas are extremely rare in performances with just over a ten tāḷas that can be regularly seen in concerts. A majority of pieces are composed in four popular tāḷas - ādi, rūpaka, miśra chāpu, and khaṇḍa chāpu. The structure of those four popular tāḷas in Carnatic music are described in {numref}`carnatic-talas-table` and illustrated in {numref}`carnatic-talas-fig`, all in caturaśra naḍe (division of a beat into two or four akṣaras). The different concepts related to the tāḷas of Carnatic music are also illustrated in {numref}`carnatic-talas-fig`. The figure shows the akṣaras with time-ticks, beats of the cycle with numbered longer time-ticks, and the sama in the cycle using ×. The aṅga boundaries are highlighted using bold and long time-ticks e.g. ādi tāḷa has 8 beats in a cycle, with 4 akṣaras in each beat leading to 32 akṣaras in a cycle, while rūpaka tāḷa has 12 akṣaras in a cycle, with 4 akṣaras in each of its 3 beats.

The case of non-isochronous beat tāḷas, miśra chāpu and khaṇḍa chāpu, need a special mention here. {numref}`carnatic-talas-fig` shows miśra chāpu to consist 14 akṣaras in a cycle. The 14 akṣaras have a definite unequal grouping structure of 6+4+4 (or 6+8 in some cases) and the boundaries of these groups are shown with visual gestures, and hence form the beats of this tāḷa {cite}`Sambamoorthy_1998`. However, in common practice, miśra chāpu can also be divided into seven equal beats. In this dissertation, we consider miśra chāpu to consist of seven uniform beats as numbered in {numref}`carnatic-talas-fig`, with beats ×, 4 and 6 being visually displayed. Similarly, khaṇḍa chāpu has 10 akṣaras in a cycle grouped into two groups as 4+6.

### Percussion in Performance
Most performances of Carnatic music are accompanied by the percussion instrument mridangam (mr̥daṅgaṁ), a double-sided barrel drum. There could however be other percussion accompaniments such as ghaṭam (the clay pot), khañjira (the Indian tambourine), thevil (a two sided drum) and mōrsiṅg (the Indian jaw harp), which follow the mridangam closely. All these instruments (except the khañjira) are pitched percussion instruments and are tuned to the tonic of the lead voice. Since the progression through the tāḷa cycles is explicitly shown through hand gestures, the mridangam is provided with substantial freedom of rhythmic improvisation during the performance. The tāḷa only provides a metrical construct, within which several different rhythmic patterns can be played and improvised.

The solo performed with the percussion accompaniments, called a tani-āvartana, demonstrates the wide variety of rhythms that can be played in a particular tāḷa. The solo performance by the percussion ensemble follows the main piece of the concert. The solo is an elaborate rhythmic improvisation within the framework of the tāḷa, but with much improvisation on the percussion patterns. The tani strives to present a showcase of the tāḷa with a variety of percussion and rhythmic patterns that can be played in the tala. The percussion instruments duel and complement each other in a solo of each instrument, with all instruments coming together to a cadential end. The patterns played can last longer than one āvartana, but stay within the framework of the tāḷa. A tani-āvartana is a showcase of the skill and talent of the percussion artists. It is replete with a variety of percussion patterns and hence is very useful for analysis of percussion patterns. The tani is often performed with a subset of the percussion instruments. The mridangam is always present, while the other instruments are optional.

### Solkaṭṭu
Percussion in Carnatic music is organized and transmitted orally with the use of onomatopoeic oral mnemonic syllables (called solkaṭṭu) representative of the different strokes of the mridangam. An oral recitation of these syllables is itself an art form called konnakōl, and is often a part of a tani-āvartana. The syllables used belong to mridangam, but is widely used with other percussion instruments used in Carnatic music. These syllables vary across schools, but provide a good representation system to define, describe and discover percussion patterns.

We consulted a senior professional Carnatic percussionist for the complete set of strokes that can be played with the mridangam. The stroke syllables of the mridangam represent the combined timbre of the left and right drum heads, and hence over 45 different strokes can be played on the mridangam. However, many of the timbrally similar strokes can be grouped together into syllable groups, assuming that such a timbral grouping is sufficient for discovery of timbrally similar percussion patterns. This timbre based grouping further enables us to work with the variability in syllables across different schools. The syllable groups, the symbol we use for them in this dissertation, and a short description is shown in {numref}`solkattu`. The different stroke names are not indicated in the table since they vary. For simplicity and brevity, we will refer to the syllable groups as just syllables in this work when there is no ambiguity. Finally however, we carefully note that the syllables also have a loosely defined functional role, and such a timbre based grouping used in this document is an approximation done only for computational analysis approaches.

## Rhythm in Hindustani Music
As previously mentioned, several different styles of Hindustani music exist, each with it's own variation of instrumentation. For example, the percussive accompaniment in a typical khyāl performance is the tabla, in the dhrupad style, it is the pakhāvaj. Here we focus on khyāl, the most popular style.

The artists in Hindustani music belong to what are called gharānās, or stylistic schools. Though all the gharānā use the same music concepts and basic style, each of them have their own nuances that are well distinguished and documented {cite}`mehta_2008`.

## Meter
{cite}`clayton_2000` provides a comprehensive introduction to rhythm in Hindustani music. The definition of tāl in Hindustani music is similar to the tāḷa in Carnatic music. A tāl has fixed-length cycles, each of which is called an āvart. An āvart is divided into isochronous basic time units called mātrā. The mātrās of a tāl are grouped into sections, sometimes with unequal time-spans, called the vibhāgs. Vibhāgs are indicated through the hand gestures of a thālī (clap) and a khālī (wave). The first mātrā of an āvart (the downbeat) is referred to as sam, marking the end of the previous cycle and the beginning of the next cycle. The first mātrā of the cycle (sam) is highly significant structurally, with many important melodic and rhythmic events happening at the sam. The sam also frequently marks the coming together of the rhythmic streams of soloist and accompanist, and the resolution point for rhythmic tension {cite}`clayton_2000`.

```{table} -  Structure of Hindustani tāls. For each tāl, the number of vibhāgs and the number of mātrās in each āvart is shown. The last column of the table shows the grouping of the mātrās in the āvart into vibhāgs, and the length of each vibhāg, e.g. each avart of rūpak tāl has three vibhāgs consisting of three, two, two mātrās respectively
:name: hind-tala-tab
| Tāl       | # Vibhāg | # Mātrās | Mātrā grouping |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Tīntāl    | 4        | 16       | 4,4,4,4        |
| Ēktāl     | 6        | 12       | 2,2,2,2,2,2    |
| Jhaptāl   | 4        | 10       | 2,3,2,3        |
| Rūpak tāl | 3        | 7        | 3,2,2          |
```
There are also tempo classes called lay in Hindustani music which can vary between ati-vilaṁbit (very slow), vilaṁbit (slow), madhya (medium), dr̥t (fast) to ati-dhr̥t (very fast). Depending on the lay, the mātrā may be further subdivided into shorter time-span pulsations, indicated through additional filler strokes of the tabla. However, since these pulses are not well defined in music theory, we consider mātrā to be lowest level pulse in the scope of this work.

As with Carnatic music, in Hindustani music there are significant differences in terminology describing meter when compared with Eurogenetic music. The definition of beat pulsation, as foot tapping instances in time, is also a problem with Hindustani music. Depending on the lay, the mātrā can be defined to be the subdivisions (for dr̥t lay) or as beats (for vilaṁbit and madhya lay). To maintain consistency, using accepted conventions, we note that the concepts of mātrā and the āvart of Hindustani music bear analogy to the beat and the bar metrical levels of Eurogenetic music. This implies that there is no well defined subdivision pulsation defined in Hindustani music. The possibly unequal vibhāgs are the sections of the tāl.

There are over 70 different Hindustani tāls defined, while about 15 tāls are performed in practice. {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig` shows four popular Hindustani tāls - tīntāl, ēktāl, jhaptāl, and rūpak tāl. The structure of these tāls are also described in {numref}`hind-tala-tab`. The figure also shows the sam (shown as ×) and the vibhāgs (indicated with thālī/khālī pattern using numerals). A khālī is shown with a 0, while the thālī are shown with non-zero numerals. The thālī and khālī pattern of a tāl decides the accents of the tāl. The sam has the strongest accent (with certain exceptions, such as rūpak tāl) followed by the thālī instants. The khālī instants have the least accent.

```{figure} images/ektal.png

- An alternative structure of Ēktāl in dr̥t lay

A jhaptāl āvart has 10 mātrās with four unequal vibhāgs ({numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`d), while a tīntāl āvart has 16 mātrās with four equal vibhāgs ({numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`a). We can also note from {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`b that the sam is a khāli in rūpak tāl, which has 7 mātrās with three unequal vibhāgs.

The special case of ēktāl needs additional mention here. Ēktāl has six equal duration vibhāgs and 12 mātrās in a cycle as shown in {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`c. However, in dr̥t lay, an alternative structure emerges, which is represented as four equal duration vibhāgs of three mātrās each as shown in {numref}`ektal`. For consistency, we use the structure as shown in {numref}`hindustani-tala-fig`c here.

### Percussion in Performance
Hindustani music uses the tabla as the main percussion accompaniment. It consists of two drums: a left hand bass drum called the bāyān or diggā and a right hand drum called the dāyān that can produce a variety of pitched sounds.

Tabla acts as the timekeeper during the performance indicating the progression through the tāl cycles using pre-defined rhythmic patterns (called the ṭhēkā) for each tāl. The lead musician improvises over these cycles, with limited rhythmic improvisation during the main piece. The ṭhēkās are specific canonical tabla bōl patterns defined for each tāl as illustrated in {numref}`thekas`. However, the musician playing tabla improvises these patterns playing many variations with filler strokes and short improvisatory patterns. {cite}`miron_2011`, {cite}`clayton_2000`, {cite}`a_e_dutta_1995`, {cite}`beronja_2008`, and {cite}`naimpalli_2005` provide a more detailed discussion of tāl in Hindustani music including ṭhēkās for commonly used tāls.

```

To showcase the nuances of a tāl as well as the skill of the percussionist with the tabla, Hindustani music performances feature tabla solos. A tabla solo is intricate and elaborate, with a variety of pre-composed forms used for developing further elaborations. There are specific principles that govern these elaborations {cite}`gottlieb_1993`. Musical forms of tabla such as the ṭhēkā, kāyadā, palaṭā, rēlā, pēśkār and gaṭ are a part of the solo performance and have different functional and aesthetic roles in a solo performance. A percussion solo shows a variety of improvisation possible in the framework of the tāl, with the role of timekeeping taken up by the lead musician during the solo.

In Hindustani music, the tempo is measured in mātrās per minute (MPM). The music has a wide range of tempo, divided into tempo classes called lay as described before. The mainly performed ones are the the slow (vilaṁbit), medium (madhya), and fast (dr̥t) classes. The boundary between these tempo classes is not well defined with possible overlaps. In this dissertation, after consultation with a professional Hindustani musician, we use the commonly agreed tempo ranges for these classes: vilaṁbit lay for a median tempo between 10-60 MPM, madhya lay for 60-150 MPM, and dr̥t lay for >150 MPM. This large range of allowed tempi means that the duration of a tāl cycle in Hindustani music ranges from less than 2 seconds to over a minute. A mātrā in vilaṁbit lay hence can last about 6 seconds, and to maintain a continuous rhythmic pulse, several filler strokes are played on the tabla. Hence the surface rhythm apparent from audio recordings can be quite different from the underlying metrical structure.

### Bōls
Similar to mridangam, the tabla repertoire is transmitted using onomatopoeic oral mnemonic syllables called the bōl. Tabla has different stylistic schools called gharānās. The repertoires of major gharānās of tabla differ in aspects such as the use of specific bōls, the dynamics of strokes, ornamentation and rhythmical phrases {cite}`Beronja_2008`. But there are also many similarities due to the fact that the same forms and standard phrases reappear across these repertoires {cite}`gottlieb_1993`.

The bōls of the tabla vary marginally within and across gharānās, and several bōls can represent the same stroke on the tabla. To address this issue, we grouped the full set of 38 syllables into timbrally similar groups resulting into a reduced set of 18 syllable groups as shown in {numref}`bols`. Though each syllable on its own has a functional role, this timbral grouping is presumed to be sufficient for discovery of percussion patterns. For this work, we limit ourselves to the reduced set of syllable groups and use them to represent patterns. For convenience, when it is clear from the context, we call the syllable groups as just syllables and denote them by the symbols in {numref}`bols`. A brief description of the timbre is also provided for each syllable

```{table} -  The bōls used in tabla are shown in second column, grouped by similarity of timbre. The symbol we use for the syllable group in the dissertation is shown in the third column and a short description of the timbre {cite}`berjone_2008` is shown in the fourth column.
