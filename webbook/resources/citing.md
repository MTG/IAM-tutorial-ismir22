In this tutorial webbook and `compiam`, tools, models, datasets, and implementations from several different people are included. Make sure to properly cite the original authors of tools and datasets that you may use through `compiam`. In this book and in `compiam` we provide citations (also as bibtex entries if you download the raw version of ``webbook/references.bib``) for all data and technologies included. **Make sure to properly cite the authors of the original work alongside `compiam`.** Thanks :)
