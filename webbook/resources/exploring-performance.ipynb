    "Music source separation is the task of automatically estimating the individual elements in a musical mixture. Apart from its creative uses, it may be very important as builing block in research pipeline, acting as a very handy pre-processing step {cite}`plaja_separation_2023`. To carefully analyse the singing voice and its components, normally having it isolated from the rest of the instruments is beneficial. \n",

However, thes systems have two problems: (1) the training data of these models does normally not include Carnatic Music examples, therefore there are instruments and practices which are completely unseed by these models, and (2) these models have a restricted set of target elements, namely (_vocals_, _bass_, _drums_, and _other_), which does not fit to Carnatic Music arrangements at all. \n",

    "To address problem (1), there have been few attemps on trying to use the multi-stem data presented above to develop Carnatic-tailored source separation systmes, although the available multi-stem recordings are collected from mixing consoles in live performances, and therefore the individual tracks are noisy (have background leakage from the rest of the sources). We can test one example of these systems here: {cite}`plaja_separation_2023`."
